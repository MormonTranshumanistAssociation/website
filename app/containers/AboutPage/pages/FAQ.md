## What is Transfigurism?
Transfigurism is religious Transhumanism, exemplified by syncretization of Mormonism and Transhumanism. The term “transfigurism” denotes advocacy for change in form, and alludes to sacred stories from many religious traditions, such as the [Universal Form of Krishna](http://vedabase.com/en/bg/11) in Hinduism, the [Radiant Face of Moses](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+34%3A29-35&version=NIV) in Judaism, the [Wakening of Gautama Buddha](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html#para-4-47) in Buddhism, the [Transfiguration of Jesus Christ](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%209:1-10&version=NIV) in Christianity, and the [Translation of the Three Nephites](http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/28) in Mormonism. Transfigurism also alludes to prophecies, such as the [Rapture](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:45-55&version=NIV) in Christianity and the [Day of Transfiguration](http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63.20-21?lang=eng#19) in Mormonism.

## I am not a Mormon. Or I am not a Christian. Or I am not a Transhumanist. Or I am an atheist. Can I still be a member of the association?
The association requires that all members support the Transhumanist Declaration and the Mormon Transhumanist Affirmation. Support does not entail a specific interpretation or perfect agreement with these statements. A person may be a member of the association in good standing while sincerely holding to an interpretation of the statements that differs from that of another member, or while not fully agreeing or even constructively disagreeing with parts of these statements, so long as that person supports the Declaration and Affirmation on the whole. For example, the “gospel of Jesus Christ” is defined in the Affirmation as “to trust in, change toward, and fully immerse our bodies and minds in the role of Christ, to become compassionate creators.” Support for this statement may not require belief in or specific beliefs about the existence of God. Interpretation of the Declaration and Affirmation is ultimately the responsibility of each member. The association does not sanction a specific interpretation, and it does not expect perfect agreement.

## What does the Mormon Transhumanist Association do?
