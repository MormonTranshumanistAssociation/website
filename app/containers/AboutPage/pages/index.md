# About the Association

## What is the Mormon Transhumanist Association?

The Mormon Transhumanist Association is the worldâ€™s largest advocacy network for ethical 
use of technology and religion to expand human abilities, as outlined in the 
[Transhumanist Declaration](/about/transhumanist-declaration) and the 
[Mormon Transhumanist Affirmation](/about/affirmation). 
Although we are neither a religious organization nor affiliated with any religious 
organization, we support our members in their personal religious affiliations, Mormon 
or otherwise, and encourage them to adapt Transhumanism to their unique situations.

## What is the relation between Mormonism and Transhumanism?

Increasingly, people are recognizing parallels and complements between Mormon and Transhumanist 
views. On one hand, [Mormonism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism) is a 
religion of the Judeo-Christian tradition that advocates immersive discipleship of 
Jesus Christ that leads to creative and compassionate works. On the other hand, 
[Transhumanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism) is a mostly secular 
ideology that advocates ethical use of technology to expand human abilities. However, 
Mormonism and Transhumanism advocate remarkably similar views of human nature and 
potential: material beings organized according to natural laws, rapidly advancing 
knowledge and power, imminent fundamental changes to anatomy and environment, and 
eventual transcendence of present limitations. 

Resources available through this site provide details about the relation between 
Mormon and Transhumanist views.
