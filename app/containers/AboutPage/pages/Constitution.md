The name of this organization shall be the Mormon Transhumanist Association (MTA), hereafter referred to as "the Association".

### Section 2: Legal

The Association shall be a 501(C)(3) nonprofit organization.

### Section 3: Contact

The principal office of the Association shall be located in the State of Utah, United States of America. The Association shall publish and maintain email, web site and postal mail addresses.

## Article II: Purpose

### Section 1: General

The purpose of the Association shall be to promote the Transhumanist Declaration and the Mormon Transhumanist Affirmation.

### Section 2: Transhumanist Declaration

(1) Humanity stands to be profoundly affected by science and technology in the future.  We envision the possibility of broadening human potential by overcoming aging, cognitive shortcomings, involuntary suffering, and our confinement to planet Earth.

 

(2) We believe that humanity's potential is still mostly unrealized.  There are possible scenarios that lead to wonderful and exceedingly worthwhile enhanced human conditions.

 

(3) We recognize that humanity faces serious risks, especially from the misuse of new technologies.  There are possible realistic scenarios that lead to the loss of most, or even all, of what we hold valuable.   Some ofthese scenarios are drastic, others are subtle.  Although all progress is change, not all change is progress.

 

(4) Research effort needs to be invested into understanding these prospects.  We need to carefully deliberate how best to reduce risks and expedite beneficial applications.  We also need forums where people can constructively discuss what should be done, and a social order where responsible decisions can be implemented.

 

(5) Reduction of existential risks, and development of means for the preservation of life and health, the alleviation of grave suffering, and the improvement of human foresight and wisdom should be pursued as urgent priorities, and heavily funded.

 

(6) Policymaking ought to be guided by responsible and inclusive moral vision, taking seriously both opportunities and risks, respecting autonomy and individual rights, and showing solidarity with and concern for the interests and dignity of all people around the globe.  We must also consider our moral responsibilities towards generations that will exist in the future.

 

(7) We advocate the well-being of all sentience, including humans, non-human animals, and any future artificial intellects, modified life forms, or other intelligences to which technological and scientific advance may give rise.

 

(8) We favour allowing individuals wide personal choice over how they enable their lives.  This includes use of techniques that may be developed to assist memory, concentration, and mental energy; life extension therapies; reproductive choice technologies; cryonics procedures; and many other possible human modification and enhancement technologies.

### Section 3: Mormon Transhumanist Affirmation

(1) We are disciples of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which is to trust in, change toward, and fully immerse our bodies and minds in the role of Christ, to become compassionate creators as exemplified and invited by Jesus.

(2) We understand the Gospel to be compatible with and complementary to many religions and philosophies, particularly those that provoke strenuous pursuit of compassionate and creative exaltation.

(3) We seek the spiritual and physical exaltation of individuals and their anatomies, as well as communities and their environments, according to their wills, desires, and laws, to the extent they are not oppressive.

(4) We believe that scientific knowledge and technological power are among the means ordained of God to enable such exaltation, including realization of diverse prophetic visions of transfiguration, immortality, resurrection, renewal of this world, and the discovery and creation of worlds without end.

(5) We feel a duty to use science and technology according to wisdom and inspiration, to identify and prepare for risks and responsibilities associated with future advances, and to persuade others to do likewise.

(6) We practice our discipleship when we offer friendship, that all may be many in one; when we receive truth, let it come from whence it may; and when we send relief, consolation and healing, that raises each other together.

### Section 1: Purpose

The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect the Association’s interest when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer or director of the Association or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction. This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations.

1. A compensation arrangement with the Association or with any entity or individual with which the Association has a transaction or arrangement, or

1. A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation arrangement with, any entity or individual with which the Association is negotiating a transaction or arrangement. Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are not insubstantial. A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest.

### Section 3: Procedures

(a) Duty to Disclose

In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the Board of Directors.

(b) Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists

After disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with the interested person, he/she shall leave the meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed and voted upon. The Board of Directors shall decide if a conflict of interest exists.

(c) Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest

1. An interested person may make a presentation at the meeting, but after the presentation, he/she shall leave the meeting during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or arrangement involving the possible conflict of interest.

1. The President shall, if appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement.

1. After exercising due diligence, the Board of Directors shall determine whether the Association can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest.

1. If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the Board of Directors shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the Association’s best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement.

(d) Violations of the Conflict of Interest Policy

1. If the Board of Directors has reasonable cause to believe a member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.

1. If, after hearing the member’s response and after making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the Board of Directors determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.

### Section 4: Records of Proceedings

The minutes of the Board of Directors shall contain:

(a) The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a financial interest in connection with an actual or possible conflict of interest, the nature of the financial interest, any action taken to determine whether a conflict of interest was present, and the Board of Directors’ decision as to whether a conflict of interest in fact existed.

(b) The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes relating to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussion, including any alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, and a record of any votes taken in connection with the proceedings.

(b) No director, officer or member with delegated powers, whose jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from the Association is prohibited from providing information regarding compensation.

### Section 6: Annual Statements

Each director, officer and member with delegated powers shall annually sign a statement which affirms such person:

(a) Has received a copy of the conflict of interest policy,

(b) Has read and understands the policy,

(c) Has agreed to comply with the policy, and

(d) Understands the Association is charitable and in order to maintain its federal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities which accomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes.

### Section 7: Periodic Reviews

To ensure the Association operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following subjects:

(a) Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey information, and the result of arm’s length bargaining.

(b) Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations conform to the Association’s written policies, are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for goods and services, further charitable purposes and do not result in inurement, impermissible private benefit or in an excess benefit transaction.
