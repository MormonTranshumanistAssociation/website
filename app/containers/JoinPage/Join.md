Help us promote practical faith in human exaltation through charitable use of science and technology, as outlined in the [Transhumanist Declaration](/about/transhumanist-declaration) and the [Mormon Transhumanist Affirmation](/about/mormon-transhumanist-affirmation). Support discussion and public awareness of emerging technologies, defend the right of individuals in free and democratic societies to adopt technologies that expand human capacities, and anticipate and propose solutions for the potential consequences of emerging technologies.
