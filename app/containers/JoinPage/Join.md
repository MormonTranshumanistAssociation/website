Help us promote practical faith in human exaltation through charitable use of science and technology, as outlined in the [Transhumanist Declaration](/about/transhumanist-declaration) and the [Mormon Transhumanist Affirmation](/about/affirmation). 

Members of the association contribute to the cause in various ways. Some engage in discussions and conferences sponsored by the association. Others write blogs, articles or books about the intersection of religion, science, spirituality and technology. All can participate in team projects, putting into practice our ideas to make the better world. We invite you to contribute to the cause!

Basic membership is free!

## <a id="donation"></a>Financial Donation
The Mormon Transhumanist Association depends on your donations to pay for this website, publications, advertising, annual & semi-annual conferences, retreats, humanitarian projects, promotional items, and other operating costs. In addition, 10% of annual profits goes to an endowment fund, to be used as determined by a super majority of voting members. The Mormon Transhumanist Association is recognized by the United States as a 501c3 non-profit organization, and your donations are tax deductible in the United States. Thank you for your support!

You may indicate the amount of your donation and any special requests, such as using a portion of your donation to cover a specific humanitarian project or your voting membership dues.
